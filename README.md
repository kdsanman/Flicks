# Project 1 - *Flicks*

**Flicks** shows the latest movies currently playing in theaters. The app utilizes the Movie Database API to display images and basic information about these movies to the user.

Time spent: **2.5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.

* [X] Views should be responsive for both landscape/portrait mode.
      * [x] In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
      * [] In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.
